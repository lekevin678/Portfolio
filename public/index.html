                    For me, computer science is like solving a puzzle; given a final product, use your knowledge and skills to build the parts to get there. And just like a puzzle, after all the hard work you have put in, the feeling when you see what you have created is pure satisfaction and joy. <br><br>

                    I am a student at Oregon State University with an anticipated graduation of Summer 2022. I am currently working on my Bachelor's degree in computer science (specializing in cybersecurity) with a minor in mathematics, and I currently have a 3.84 GPA.<br><br>

                    Computer science caught my attention because of its problem solving aspect. I enjoy the process of finding and creating that one algorithm that will solve my problem efficiently. I find myself entranced in my work as I am coding to finish the project. And I love the feeling of satisfaction when I finally get to see my work run successfully. <br><br>

                    On the technical side, I have excelled in courses that focused on algorithms, computer architecture, data structures, databases, computer networks, operating systems, and web development. Also, by the end of the summer of 2021, I will have completed coursework related to Cybersecurity; which includes cryptography, network security, and computer forensics. I have skills and experience in C/C++, Java, Javascript, Python, Github, SQL, HTML/CSS, and technical troubleshooting.<br><br>

                    My skills in programming are on display in my projects. The <a href="/projects" style="color: #3e76c9;font-style: italic;"> projects </a> section contains my coursework and personal projects that I have completed. My favorite personal project of mine is Health is Wealth. In this project, I was able to use my programming skills that I have accumulated throughout the years to solve a problem that I (and maybe many others) had in finding healthy foods that match my health goals. <br><br>

                    I am excited for any opportunities that come my way. <a href="/contact" style="color: #3e76c9;font-style: italic;"> Let's get in touch! </a> <br><br><br>
